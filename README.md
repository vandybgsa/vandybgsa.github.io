- To make any edits to the site content, just edit the `Rmd` files for the relevant site page you're changing, then knit to HTML. 
- The `_site.yml` combines everything into the site format you see at http://vandybgsa.github.io, and can be adjusted to add more tabs/content if necessary.
- Any changes must be performed using `git`, then pushed to this repository. The website is hosted using GitHub Pages so it will then take effect on the hosted site shortly thereafter.
